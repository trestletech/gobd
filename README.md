## gobd

Interface between Go (golang) and OBD II. This code could be used to interface with e.g. an ELM OBDII <-> USB device to allow for interactions between the two devices.

```
# Edit the path to the USB modem in examples/main.go, then...
go run examples/main.go
```

to poll for some data from the vehicle.
